It's kind of cool how it auto-updates and lets you see what's happening in real time. It would be reassuring if it would let me resize the image and show me exactly the style I could expect to see, but being able to see even this much is plenty compared to other word processors.

I'm trying to remember a few things I didn't quite get, such as: does creating a post require build time or does it just post? I know actions I take in the repo, such as changing the name or look of the site's current layout, would definitely require build time, and all of the resources would come with that, but building this the first time didn't take any time at all, so I'm certain that's fine.

Anyway, this is a cool little setup, I'm looking forward to seeing this post and figuring things out from there. I read the README file and it said to go into the config file in the repo to change things about the site, like the headers and things like that, so I'll probably play with that next.
